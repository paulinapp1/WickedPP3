Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulinapp1/WickedPP3.git

```

    "ConnectionString": "mongodb://your-mongo-db-url",
    "WickedGame": "WickedGame",
    "User": "User",
    "WickedScores": "WickedScores"
  }
}


## **4. Run the Application**

To launch the application, simply click Start (the green play button) in Visual Studio or press F5. The application will open in your default web browser, where you can begin playing the game.

If you are using MongoDB locally, ensure that your MongoDB instance is running and accessible to the application.

Additionally, you can modify the gameâ€™s difficulty by adjusting the map size or other settings within the GameInstance class.
